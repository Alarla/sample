I was really worried about it because I don't know what I'm going to do after I leave Hong Kong. My partner and I talked about business opportunities in the Philippines which will provide for us our daily needs and will also serve as our past-time during our vacants. After a week, we asked our friends and kins about the business until we came to Dasmarinas, Cavite and we found this place a good location to do our business due to its industriality. After conducting a feasibility study, CROFIL was born. "CRO" stands for Croatian and "FIL" stands for Filipino. Our Crofil Financing officially began on August 28, 2003 - market was good but we're having a hard time to look for a company to penetrate for an easy release of loan and collection. We tried personal loan, but it isn't enough to resolve the problem. It is too difficult for us to give up the business since all of our savings was invested in there. There's no way to go but to find another solution and try and try and try to resolve the problem all over again. This has convinced us to build a company of our own and have our employees. We started finding employees to deploy as Crofil Manpower was born on April 2005. After a few months, the company made a big progress and it prospered. In 2007, we were able to manage to have 10 clients and 1,500 employees was deployed. Crofil Financing paired up with Crofil Manpower; loaning and deduction of salaries became an easy-flowing activity. The company has reached its lowest in 2007 when the crisis in United States caused deflation in international business industries. We had lost our sales amounting 2 million php. The only companies that remained on track were the local companies like URC products and Magnolia products. In 2009, we began to find more clients and fortunately, it caused an increase in sales as well as the number of deployments. Time came in my life where I almost gave up but I started to reflect upon my employees - they need money so they can provide their kids a food to eat, a good shelter to live on and education. Thinking about those people who depend on me motivates me and keeps me moving forward. They were the reason why I get up, work hard and believe in myself in the business I am doing."<br></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ~Leticia San Antonio&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CROFIL Manpower, Owner<br><br></p></div>
